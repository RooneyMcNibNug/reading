# reading
This rep serves as a reading log of books I have lying around. `BOOKS_RETAINED.csv` contains the books I own and if I have read them yet or not, also what I am currently reading.

I don't want to use services like Goodreads that are owned by Amazon and constantly hoovering user data, so I might try and drop some reviews here or on [my blog](https://rooneymcnibnug.github.io).

NOTE: This does not include any textbooks, it is solely fiction and non-fiction that I read in my spare time.
